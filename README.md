## Project

* This project is a basic RPG-style game where the user gets to pick a character and strategically pick their enemy in the correct order to win.

* Each character has a set amount of health points, attack power, and counter-attack power.
    1. attack power will only be used by the user's character, and increments each turn
    2. counter-attack power will be used by the user's enemies, and is static

* This Project was made and is maintained by Joe Keegan.
